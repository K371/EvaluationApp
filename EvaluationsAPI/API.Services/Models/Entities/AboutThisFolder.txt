This folder should contain all Entity classes this application uses.
They should be divided into subfolders in some neat manner.
Preferably, there should be no files in the root of this folder.
If in doubt, put the file in the "General" folder (but we must
be on the lookout for it getting too big). 

As a general rule of thumb, if at least two files have a common prefix
(such as "Course") AND they belong to that concept, they should be put
into a subfolder of that name.

There will be entities that could belong to at least two folders,
and in that case, pick one.
